# üì¶ RARLab's `rar.exe` .NET Wrapper

A full-featured .NET wrapper for RARLab's official `rar.exe` command-line tool. This library empowers .NET developers to seamlessly access and control almost all the functionality provided by `rar.exe` ‚Äî such as compressing, extracting, listing, testing, creating recovery volumes and managing RAR archives ‚Äî from within their applications.

------------------

## üëã Introduction

RARLab provides a powerful command-line tool, `rar.exe`, with deep support for creating and extracting RAR archives. However, using it directly from .NET requires manually spawning processes, constructing CLI arguments, and parsing the textual output ‚Äî a repetitive and error-prone task.

This project eliminates that friction by wrapping a range of `rar.exe` functionalities in an intuitive .NET interface.

The wrapper is implemented in VB.NET but is fully compatible with both VB.NET and C# projects. It targets .NET Framework 4.8.1 by default, but can be easily migrated to .NET 5+ without issues, as it relies on no external dependencies other than the user-supplied `rar.exe` executable.

## üëå Features

‚úÖ Archive Creation and Modification
Create, fresh or update .rar files from one or multiple files/folders, with support for recursive inclusion, solid archives, volume splitting, and compression tuning.

‚úÖ Extraction Support
Extract archives to custom locations, with full support for password-protected archives, overwrite rules, and directory flattening.

‚úÖ Archive Listing
Retrieve file lists (size, timestamps, CRC, etc.) from existing archives programmatically.

‚úÖ Password Support
Handle encrypted archives with ease, both when creating and extracting, using secure password input.

‚úÖ Advanced RAR Options
Expose almost the full range of RAR‚Äôs features: recovery records, archive locking, comment injection, timestamps, file exclusions, and more.

‚úÖ Multi-volume Archive Handling
Create and extract archives split into multiple volumes ‚Äî ideal for large datasets or removable media.

‚úÖ Error Handling and Output Parsing
Automatically parse output from `rar.exe`, detect errors, and raise structured exceptions where appropriate.

‚úÖ Cross-language Usability
Though written in VB.NET, the wrapper is compiled into a .NET assembly (a dll library), making it easy to use in C#, F#, and other .NET-supported languages.

‚úÖ No External Dependencies
Only dependency is `rar.exe` from RARLab ‚Äî no third-party libraries required.

## üß∞ Requirements

- [`rar.exe`](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) from RARLab's WinRAR (command-line version only). 
  Please note that `rar.exe` is not free, it requires a product license (the same from a licensed `WinRAR` product).

## ü§ñ Getting Started

Clone this repository or download the latest compilation by clicking [here](https://github.com/ElektroStudios/RARLab-RAR-Wrapper-Library-for-NET/releases/latest).

Add the project to your solution or reference the compiled DLL file.

Ensure `rar.exe` is present in your system environment path or specify its full path in the wrapper configuration. A working product license would also be required for using almost all the `rar.exe` functionalities.

Start compressing or extracting archives with simple method calls!
