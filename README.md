# üì¶ RARLab's `rar.exe` .NET Wrapper Library

A full-featured .NET wrapper for RARLab's official `rar.exe` command-line tool. This library empowers .NET developers to seamlessly access and control almost all the functionality provided by `rar.exe` ‚Äî such as compressing, extracting, listing, testing, creating recovery volumes and managing RAR archives ‚Äî from within their applications.

------------------

## üëã Introduction

RARLab provides a powerful command-line tool, `rar.exe`, with deep support for creating and extracting RAR archives. However, using it directly from .NET requires manually spawning processes, constructing CLI arguments, and parsing the textual output ‚Äî a repetitive and error-prone task.

This project eliminates that friction by wrapping a range of `rar.exe` functionalities in an intuitive .NET interface.

The wrapper is implemented in VB.NET but is fully compatible with both VB.NET and C# projects. It targets .NET Framework 4.8.1 by default, but can be easily migrated to .NET 5+ without issues, as it relies on no external dependencies other than the user-supplied `rar.exe` executable.

## üëå Features

‚úÖ Archive Creation and Modification
Create, fresh or update .rar files from one or multiple files/folders, with support for recursive inclusion, solid archives, volume splitting, and compression tuning.

‚úÖ Extraction Support
Extract archives to custom locations, with full support for password-protected archives, overwrite rules, and directory flattening.

‚úÖ Archive Listing
Retrieve file lists (size, timestamps, CRC, etc.) from existing archives programmatically.

‚úÖ Password Support
Handle encrypted archives with ease, both when creating and extracting, using secure password input.

‚úÖ Advanced RAR Options
Expose almost the full range of RAR‚Äôs features: recovery records, archive locking, comment injection, timestamps, file exclusions, and more.

‚úÖ Multi-volume Archive Handling
Create and extract archives split into multiple volumes ‚Äî ideal for large datasets or removable media.

‚úÖ Error Handling and Output Parsing
Automatically parse output from `rar.exe`, detect errors, and raise structured exceptions where appropriate.

‚úÖ Cross-language Usability
Though written in VB.NET, the wrapper is compiled into a .NET assembly (a dll library), making it easy to use in C#, F#, and other .NET-supported languages.

‚úÖ No External Dependencies
Only dependency is `rar.exe` from RARLab ‚Äî no third-party libraries required.

## üß∞ Requirements

- [`rar.exe`](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) from RARLab's WinRAR (command-line version only). 
  Please note that `rar.exe` is not free, it requires a product license (the same from a licensed `WinRAR` product).

## ü§ñ Getting Started

Clone this repository or download the latest compilation by clicking [here](https://github.com/ElektroStudios/RARLab-RAR-Wrapper-Library-for-NET/releases/latest).

Add the project to your solution or reference the compiled DLL file.

Ensure `rar.exe` is present in your system environment path or specify its full path in the wrapper configuration. A working product license would also be required for using almost all the `rar.exe` functionalities.

Start compressing or extracting archives with simple method calls!

## üìù Usage Examples

### Prepare a full featured command for RAR archive creation using the `RarCreationCommand` class:

VB NET:

    Imports DevCase.RAR
    Imports DevCase.RAR.Commands

    Dim archivePath As String = "C:\New Archive.rar"
    Dim filesToAdd As String = "C:\Directory to add\"
    
    Dim creationCommand As New RarCreationCommand(RarCreationMode.Add, archivePath, filesToAdd) With {
        .RarExecPath = ".\rar.exe",
        .RarLicenseData = "(Your license key)",
        .RecurseSubdirectories = True,
        .EncryptionProperties = Nothing,
        .SolidCompression = False,
        .CompressionMode = RarCompressionMode.Normal,
        .DictionarySize = RarDictionarySize.Mb__128,
        .OverwriteMode = RarOverwriteMode.Overwrite,
        .FilePathMode = RarFilePathMode.ExcludeBaseDirFromFileNames,
        .FileTimestamps = RarFileTimestamps.All,
        .AddQuickOpenInformation = TriState.True,
        .ProcessHardLinksAsLinks = True,
        .ProcessSymbolicLinksAsLinks = TriState.True,
        .DuplicateFileMode = RarDuplicateFileMode.Enabled,
        .FileChecksumMode = RarFileChecksumMode.BLAKE2sp,
        .ArchiveComment = New RarArchiveComment("Hello world!"),
        .RecoveryRecordPercentage = 0,
        .SplitIntoVolumes = Nothing,
        .FileTypesToStore = Nothing
    }

C#:

    using DevCase.RAR;
    using DevCase.RAR.Commands;

    string archivePath = "C:\\New Archive.rar";
    string filesToAdd = "C:\\Directory to add\\";
    
    RarCreationCommand creationCommand = new RarCreationCommand(RarCreationMode.Add, archivePath, filesToAdd) {
        RarExecPath = ".\\rar.exe",
        RarLicenseData = "(Your license key)",
        RecurseSubdirectories = true,
        EncryptionProperties = null,
        SolidCompression = false,
        CompressionMode = RarCompressionMode.Normal,
        DictionarySize = RarDictionarySize.Mb__128,
        OverwriteMode = RarOverwriteMode.Overwrite,
        FilePathMode = RarFilePathMode.ExcludeBaseDirFromFileNames,
        FileTimestamps = RarFileTimestamps.All,
        AddQuickOpenInformation = Microsoft.VisualBasic.TriState.True,
        ProcessHardLinksAsLinks = true,
        ProcessSymbolicLinksAsLinks = Microsoft.VisualBasic.TriState.True,
        DuplicateFileMode = RarDuplicateFileMode.Enabled,
        FileChecksumMode = RarFileChecksumMode.BLAKE2sp,
        ArchiveComment = new RarArchiveComment("Hello world!"),
        RecoveryRecordPercentage = 0,
        SplitIntoVolumes = null,
        FileTypesToStore = null
    };

### To retrieve the full command-line arguments of our Command:

    Console.WriteLine($"Command-line arguments: {creationCommand}")

### Execute the command using the `RarCommandExecutor` class:

VB NET:

    Using rarExecutor As New RarCommandExecutor(creationCommand)
    
        AddHandler rarExecutor.OutputDataReceived,
            Sub(sender As Object, e As DataReceivedEventArgs)
                Console.WriteLine($"[Output] {Date.Now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - {e.Data}")
            End Sub
    
        AddHandler rarExecutor.ErrorDataReceived,
            Sub(sender As Object, e As DataReceivedEventArgs)
                If e.Data IsNot Nothing Then
                    Console.WriteLine($"[Error] {Date.Now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - {e.Data}")
                End If
            End Sub
    
        AddHandler rarExecutor.Exited,
            Sub(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
                Dim pr As Process = DirectCast(sender, Process)
                Dim rarExitCode As RarExitCode = DirectCast(pr.ExitCode, RarExitCode)
                Console.WriteLine($"[Exited] {Date.Now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - rar.exe process has terminated with exit code {pr.ExitCode} ({rarExitCode})")
            End Sub
    
        Dim exitcode As RarExitCode = rarExecutor.ExecuteRarAsync().Result
    End Using

C#:

    using (RarCommandExecutor rarExecutor = new RarCommandExecutor(creationCommand)) {
    
      rarExecutor.OutputDataReceived += (object sender, DataReceivedEventArgs e) => {
          Console.WriteLine($"[Output] {DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - {e.Data}");
      };
    
      rarExecutor.ErrorDataReceived += (object sender, DataReceivedEventArgs e) => {
          if (e.Data != null)
          {
            Console.WriteLine($"[Error] {DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - {e.Data}");
          }
      };
    
      rarExecutor.Exited += (object sender, EventArgs e) => {
          Process pr = (Process)sender;
          RarExitCode rarExitCode = (RarExitCode)pr.ExitCode;
          Console.WriteLine($"[Exited] {DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - rar.exe process has terminated with exit code {pr.ExitCode} ({rarExitCode})");
      };
    
      RarExitCode exitcode = rarExecutor.ExecuteRarAsync().Result;
    }
